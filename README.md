# TDSE-Laser-Atom

A 1+1 dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger solver for He atom interacting with laser pulses written in Fortran 90. The ground state is obtained with the imaginary time evolution method. The wavefunction is propagated in the laser field with the split-operater FFT method. The joint momentum spectrum is obtained with the splitting-domain method.
